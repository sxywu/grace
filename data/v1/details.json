Believers in this doomsday event usually refer to this object as  Nibiru or Planet X. The idea was first put forward in 1995 by Nancy Lieder, founder of the website ZetaTalk. Lieder describes herself as a contactee with the ability to receive messages from extraterrestrials from the Zeta Reticuli star system through an implant in her brain. She states that she was chosen to warn mankind that the object would sweep through the inner Solar System in May 2003 (though that date was later postponed) causing Earth to undergo a physical pole shift that would destroy most of humanity.The prediction has subsequently spread beyond Lieder's website and has been embraced by numerous Internet doomsday groups. In the late 2000s, it became closely associated with the 2012 phenomenon. Since 2012, the Nibiru cataclysm has frequently reappeared in the popular media, usually linked to newsmaking astronomical objects such as Comet ISON or Planet Nine. Although the name \"Nibiru\" is derived from the works of the ancient astronaut writer Zecharia Sitchin and his interpretations of Babylonian and Sumerian mythology, he denied any connection between his work and various claims of a coming apocalypse. A prediction by self-described \"Christian numerologist\" David Meade that the Nibiru cataclysm would occur on 23 September 2017 received extensive media coverage.\nThe idea that a planet-sized object will collide with or closely pass by Earth in the near future is not supported by any scientific evidence and has been rejected by astronomers and planetary scientists as pseudoscience and an Internet hoax. Such an object would have destabilised the orbits of the planets to the extent that their effects would be easily observable today. Astronomers have hypothesized many planets beyond Neptune, and though many have been disproved, there are some that remain viable candidates such as Planet Nine. All the current candidates are in orbits that keep them well beyond Neptune throughout their orbit, even when they are closest to the Sun.","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/V838_Mon_HST.jpg"},{"name":"Katrina Ligett","backlinks":["Katrina (given name)","List of people by Erdős number","Avrim Blum","Exponential mechanism (differential privacy)","Differential privacy","User:Edgars2007/Sandbox","Talk:Katrina Ligett","User:Stinglehammer/STEM/Science"],"references":["//arxiv.org/abs/1109.2229","//doi.org/10.1145%2F1374376.1374464","//citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.116.5105","//doi.org/10.1145%2F1374376.1374430"],"info":{"general":{"name":"Katrina Ligett","nationality":"US","fields":"Computer Science","workplaces":"Hebrew University","almaMater":"Carnegie Mellon University","doctoralAdvisor":"Avrim Blum","knownFor":["Algorithmic game theory","privacy"]},"tables":[],"lists":[]},"links":["Algorithmic game theory","ArXiv","Avrim Blum","Brown University","California Institute of Technology","Carnegie Mellon University","CiteSeerX","Computer Science","Computer science","DBLP","Digital object identifier","Doctoral advisor","Economics","Hebrew University","International Standard Book Number","Price of Anarchy","Privacy","US"],"summary":"Katrina Ligett is an American computer scientist.

In the area of power-aware computer architecture, Martonosi is known for her work on the Wattch power modeling infrastructure. Among the first architecture-level power modeling tools, Wattch demonstrated that early-stage power modeling tools could be accurate enough to allow computer architects to assess processor power consumption early enough in the design process for power to have a substantive influence on design choices. Martonosi's group has also performed research on real-system power measurement, and on power and thermal management.In the area of mobile systems, some of Martonosi's early work included the design and deployment of mobile sensors for tracking zebras in Kenya  This work demonstrated the use of delay tolerant protocols  and low-power GPS devices  for wildlife tracking.  More recently, Martonosi has researched human mobility patterns  and has developed novel mobile applications for crowdsourcing traffic information.She is also noted for her leadership in \nbroadening participation in computing. She is currently co-Chair of the CRA-W Board. In 2016, she was appointed to a six year term as an Andrew Dickson White professor-at-large at Cornell University.On September 23, 2019, the National Science Foundation announced that Martonosi had been selected to serve as head of the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) at NSF.. She will start on February 1, 2020.","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg"},{"name":"Alexia Massalin","backlinks":["Self-modifying code","User:AlexNewArtBot/LGBTSearchResult/archive2","Talk:Alexia Massalin","Henry Massalin","User:AlexNewArtBot/TestFeedSearchResult/archive10","User:Pascal666/living/4","User talk:Pi Delport/Archive 2008","User:Tony Sidaway/Living people/tranche 058","User:AnomieBOT/Nobots Hall of Shame","User:AnomieBOT/Nobots Hall of Shame/0","User talk:Diego Moya/Recommendations","Index of women scientists articles","User:Edgars2007/Sandbox","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women scientists/index","List of alumni of Cooper Union","Alexia (given name)","Wikipedia:WikiProject Academic Journals/Journals cited by Wikipedia/P51","Quaject","Wikipedia:Meetup/AWIS Edit-a-thon: Ada Lovelace Day at WVU","Wikipedia:Meetup/Women in STEAM edit-a-thon @ WVU","Wikipedia:WikiProject Academic Journals/Journals cited by Wikipedia/Publisher4"],"references":["http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs343/resources/superoptimizer.pdf","//doi.org/10.1145%2F36206.36194","https://web.archive.org/web/20170704123738/https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs343/resources/superoptimizer.pdf","http://hpux.connect.org.uk/hppd/hpux/Gnu/superopt-2.5/readme.html","https://www.wired.com/1996/12/ffmassalin/","https://web.archive.org/web/20170704124039/https://www.wired.com/1996/12/ffmassalin/","http://www.scs.stanford.edu/nyu/04fa/sched/readings/synthesis.pdf","https://web.archive.org/web/20170704122520/http://www.scs.stanford.edu/nyu/04fa/sched/readings/synthesis.pdf","https://lwn.net/Articles/270081/","https://lwn.net/Articles/270081/","https://web.archive.org/web/20170704124312/https://lwn.net/Articles/270081/","https://web.archive.org/web/20170704124715/http://www.microunity.com/company/#am","http://www.microunity.com/company/#am","https://www.quora.com/Henry-Massalin/What-is-Alexia-Massalin-creator-of-Synthesis-kernel-working-on-right-now/answer/David-Carpe?srid=WM5&share=1","https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/24/technology/in-the-land-of-the-weird-standing-out-takes-a-little-work.html","//www.worldcat.org/issn/0362-4331","https://web.archive.org/web/20170704124444/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/24/technology/in-the-land-of-the-weird-standing-out-takes-a-little-work.html"],"info":{"general":{"name":"Alexia Massalin","birthName":"Henry Massalin","birthDate":{"date":"1962-01-01T05:00:00.000Z","age":57},"birthPlace":"Astoria, Queens","residence":"United States","citizenship":"United States","nationality":"United States","fields":"Operating system","workplaces":"MicroUnity","almaMater":["Bachelor of Engineering","Master of Engineering"],"thesisTitle":"Synthesis: An Efficient Implementation of Fundamental Operating System Services","thesisUrl":"http://valerieaurora.org/synthesis/SynthesisOS/","thesisYear":"1992","doctoralAdvisor":"Calton Pu","knownFor":"Superoptimization"},"tables":[],"lists":[]},"links":["Association for Computing Machinery","Astoria, Queens","Bachelor of Engineering","Calton Pu","Columbia University","Computer science","Computer scientist","Cooper Union","Croatia","Dennis Ritchie","Digital object identifier","Doctoral advisor","Gary Andrew Poole","Henry Massalin","International Standard Book Number","International Standard Serial Number","Ken Thompson","Manhattan","Marvin Minsky","Master of Engineering","MicroUnity","New York (state)","Operating system","Optimizing compiler","Quaject","Randy Katz","SIGOPS","Self-modifying code","Superoptimization","Superoptimizer","Synthesis kernel","The New York Times","Thesis","Trieste","Unix","Wayback Machine","Wired (magazine)"],"summary":"Alexia Massalin (formerly Henry Massalin) is an American computer scientist and programmer.

McGraw (née Boehme) was an American computer programmer who, together with Arthur Samuel and Gene Amdahl, invented open addressing based hash tables in 1954.\nAfter studying economics, McGraw began working as a computer programmer for The Prudential Life Insurance Company in the early 1950s, using a UNIVAC computer. Prudential sent her to IBM to learn how to program the IBM 701, but (believing that Prudential would not purchase this computer) she applied for a job at IBM, and was hired there in 1953 by Gene Amdahl. She continued to work at IBM until at least 1970.In 1954, McGraw was working with Amdahl and Arthur Samuel on an assembler (a program for converting a textual description of a sequence of computer instructions into machine code) and she was tasked with implementing a symbol table for it. Together, Amdahl, McGraw, and Samuel solved this problem by inventing the methods of open addressing and linear probing, still frequently used in modern hash table data structures. This was not the first use of hash tables – hash tables with chaining had already been described in a 1953 memo by Hans Peter Luhn – but was nevertheless an influential early contribution to the theory of data structures."},{"name":"Joanna McGrenere","backlinks":["Joanna","List of people by Erdős number","Graphics Interface","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women in Red/Metrics/September 2019","Leah Findlater","McGrenere","Karyn Moffat","Talk:Joanna McGrenere"],"references":["https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~joanna/CV_McGrenere_Aug_2019.pdf","https://cra.org/cra-wp/scholarships-and-awards/awards/beca-award-program/","http://cacsaic.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/awards_2011","https://www.cs.ubc.ca/award/2017/08/royal-society-canada-college-new-scholars-artists-and-scientists"],"info":{"general":{},"tables":[],"lists":[]},"links":["Adaptive user interface","Computer scientist","Computing Research Association","Google Scholar","Human-computer interaction","IBM","Karyn Moffat","Kellogg S.

Pancake is an ethnographer and computer scientist who works as a professor of electrical engineering and computer science and Intel Faculty Fellow at Oregon State University, and as the director of the Northwest Alliance for Computational Science & Engineering. She is known for her pioneering work on usability engineering for high performance computing. In 2018 she was elected for a two-year term as president of the Association for Computing Machinery.Pancake earned a bachelor's degree in environmental design from Cornell University, and then studied anthropology at Louisiana State University. After working for the Peace Corps in Peru, she spent ten years in Guatemala studying the Maya peoples; for over six of these years she was curator of the Ixchel Museum of Indigenous Textiles and Clothing. However, the political unrest in Guatemala in the early 1980s caused her to return to the US, where she became a graduate student in engineering at Auburn University, the first woman in the program. She received a PhD in Computer Engineering in 1986. For 10 years she split her time between her university appointment (first at Auburn, then at Oregon State) and an appointment as Visiting Scientist at the Cornell Theory Center. She performed the first usability studies of software tools for high performance computing, and found methods of improving the usability of these tools based on her knowledge of color perception, response time, short-term memory, and programming errors.For over two decades, Pancake has been active with the ACM/IEEE SC (Supercomputing) Conference, serving as general chair of SC99 and in numerous other positions. She founded the Parallel Tools Consortium in 1993 and led several software standards efforts.

She joined the project in November 1990, while an undergraduate maths student enrolled in a sandwich course at Leicester Polytechnic (now De Montfort University).  Pellow recalled having little experience with programming languages, \"... apart from using a bit of Pascal and FORTRAN as part of my degree course.\"Almost immediately after Berners-Lee completed the WorldWideWeb web browser for the NeXT platform, Pellow was tasked with creating a browser, after a quick lesson in C programming.  She wrote the generic Line Mode Browser  that could run on non-NeXT systems. The WWW team began to improve on her work, creating several experimental versions. Pellow was involved in porting the browser to different types of computers.She left CERN at the end of August 1991, but returned to CERN after graduating in 1992, and worked with Robert Cailliau on MacWWW, the first web browser for the classic Mac OS.","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/NPellow.jpg"},{"name":"Radia Perlman","backlinks":["Alexander Graham

In 2005, she was named a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers for contributions to image and video analysis and affective computing.  In 2019 she received one of the highest professional honors accorded an engineer, election to the National Academy of Engineering for her contributions on affective computing and wearable computing.Picard is credited with starting the branch of computer science known as affective computing with her 1997 book of the same name. This book described the importance of emotion in intelligence, the vital role human emotion communication has to relationships between people, and the possible effects of emotion recognition by robots and wearable computers. Her work in this field has led to an expansion into autism research and developing devices that could help humans recognize nuances in human emotions.","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Panel_Discussion_Close-up%2C_Science%2C_Faith%2C_and_Technology_Cropped.jpg"},{"name":"Joëlle Pineau","backlinks":["Sebastian Thrun","McGill University School of Computer Science","User:Stinglehammer/STEM/Science","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women in Red/Metrics/July 2018","Jöelle Pineau","Joelle Pineau","Talk:Joëlle Pineau","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women in Red/List of Wikipedia articles created using Quicksilver","Pineau (surname)","C2 Montréal","Mila (research institute)"],"references":["https://lactualite.com/techno/2017/10/13/le-cv-joelle-pineau/","https://www.20minutes.fr/arts-stars/culture/2300215-20180703-facebook-joelle-pineau-femme-pese-milieu-intelligence-artificielle","https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/","https://www.cifar.ca/bio/joelle-pineau","https://www.ri.cmu.edu/publications/point-based-value-iteration-an-anytime-algorithm-for-pomdps/","https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-people/joelle-pineau/","https://publications.mcgill.ca/reporter/2017/09/joelle-pineau-to-head-new-facebook-ai-fair-lab-in-montreal/","https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rll/guide2001/flo/html/flo.html","https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~mausam/AIpresentation/elderly.htm","https://publications.mcgill.ca/reporter/2017/04/a-robot-you-can-drive-meet-mcgills-smartwheeler/","https://rsc-src.ca/en/college-new-scholars-artists-and-scientists","http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/Prizes-Prix/Steacie-Steacie/Index-Index_eng.asp","http://mashable.france24.com/tech-business/20180629-joelle-pineau-facebook-fair-ia-mcgill-usi","http://proceedings.mlr.press/v56/Thodoroff16.html","https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/about/editorialTeam","http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/editorial-board.html","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JdeTqRhwEs","https://research.fb.com/a-conversation-with-dr-joelle-pineau-head-of-new-fair-lab-in-montreal","https://research.fb.com/programs/faculty-awards/page/8/","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYfp9-kZxzI","https://qz.com/1118671/the-titans-of-ai-are-getting-their-work-double-checked-by-students/","https://www.re-work.co/events/deep-learning-summit-montreal-canada-track1-2017/speakers/joelle-pineau","https://www.c2montreal.com/speaker/joelle-pineau/","https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/governor-generals-innovation-award-ai-pioneer-joelle-pineau-297076","https://innovation.gg.ca/winner/dr-joelle-pineau/"],"info":{"general":{"name":"Joelle Pineau","workplaces":["Facebook","McGill University"],"awards":"AAAI Fellow","almaMater":["Carnegie Mellon University","University of Waterloo"],"birthDate":{"date":"1974-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"},"academicAdvisors":["Sebastian Thrun","Geoffrey J.

She taught at Hofstra University on Long Island nine years before becoming department chair at Union College in 2004 where she worked on updating the introductory courses in computer science to appeal to underrepresented groups in computer science and to broaden non-major exposure to the field of computer science.\nFrom 2012-2017, she served as the chair of ACM's Council on Women in Computing.  She served as a program director at the United States National Science Foundation in the Division of Undergraduate Education during 2013-2014.  Her work as program director ended early as a result of questions related to political activity in the 1980s. In 1999, Barr was the recipient of the NSF POWRE award, and in 2007, she was awarded the NSF Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) Pathways to Revitalized Undergraduate Computing Education (CPATH) Institutional Transformation Award.In 2008, Barr and Elaine Weyuker organized a major ACM-W initiative to provide scholarships to women students who want to attend research conferences.  This program is still running and annually provides between 30 and 40 scholarships a year for women students from around the world who are interested in attending conferences that will help them further their interests in computing. In 2016, she served as an Academic Corner Speaker at the Anita Borg Institute international conference Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.She became an ACM Senior Member in 2009 and earned the 2016 Outstanding Contribution to ACM Award for broadening the impact of ACM-W, increasing its effectiveness in supporting women in computing worldwide, and encouraging participation in ACM.In 2017, she was named the first person to hold the Jean E. Sammet Chair in Computer Science at Mount Holyoke College.","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Desktop_computer_clipart_-_Yellow_theme.svg"},{"name":"Regina Barzilay","backlinks":["MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory","MacArthur Fellows Program","Wikipedia:WikiProject Israel","MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department","List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty","Regina (name)","Wikipedia:WikiProject Israel/Recognized content","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women scientists","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women scientists/Recognized content","Wikipedia:WikiProject Computing/Recognized content","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women in Red/Showcase","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women scientists/sandbox","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women scientists/Showcase","User:Stinglehammer/STEM/Science","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women in Red/sandbox/Showcase","Wikipedia:CHECKWIKI/WPC 064 dump","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women in Red/The World Contest","User:Gerda Arendt/2017","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women in Red/Metrics/November 2017","Wikipedia:Meetup/Writing STEM Women Into Wikipedia WGS S10","User:Fz54","User talk:Fz54","Talk:Regina Barzilay","Template:Did you know nominations/Regina Barzilay","Barzilay","Wikipedia:Recent additions/2018/January","Wikipedia:Main Page history/2018 January 12","Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Draft:First draft","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women in Red/Recognized content","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women in Red/DYK","User talk:12.230.65.20","List of Cornell University alumni (natural sciences)"],"references":["https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0448168","http://www2.technologyreview.com/tr35/profile.aspx?TRID=85","https://www.macfound.org/fellows/983/","http://engineering.columbia.edu/news/barzilay-macarthur","https://www.timesofisrael.com/genius-grants-to-israeli-computer-linguist-opera-kingpin-with-israeli-parents/","https://news.mit.edu/2016/barzilay-named-delta-electronics-professor-0523","http://www.wbur.org/radioboston/2017/10/11/mit-professor-macarthur-genius","https://www.macfound.org/fellows/983/","https://www.wired.com/2002/03/the-push-for-news-returns/","https://news.mit.edu/2017/putting-data-in-the-hands-of-doctors-regina-barzilay-0216","http://people.csail.mit.edu/regina/"],"info":{"general":{"name":"Regina Barzilay","birthDate":{"date":"1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"},"birthPlace":"Moldavia","nationality":"Israelis","field":["Computer science","Natural language processing"],"workInstitution":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Weizmann Institute of Science"],"almaMater":["Ben-Gurion University of the Negev","Columbia University"],"doctoralAdvisor":"Kathleen McKeown","thesisTitle":"Information Fusion for Multidocument.

Dayhoff was a professor at Georgetown University Medical Center and a noted research biochemist at the National Biomedical Research Foundation (NBRF) where she pioneered the application of mathematics and computational methods to the field of biochemistry.  She dedicated her career to applying the evolving computational technologies to support advances in biology and medicine, most notably the creation of protein and nucleic acid databases and tools to interrogate the databases.  She originated one of the first substitution matrices, point accepted mutations (PAM). The one-letter code used for amino acids was developed by her, reflecting an attempt to reduce the size of the data files used to describe amino acid sequences in an era of punch-card computing.\nHer PhD degree was from Columbia University in the Department of Chemistry, where she devised computational methods to calculate molecular resonance energies of several organic compounds.  She did postdoctoral studies at the Rockefeller Institute (now Rockefeller University) and the University of Maryland, and joined the newly established National Biomedical Research Foundation in 1959. She was the first woman to hold office in the Biophysical Society and the first person to serve as both secretary and eventually president.","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Card_puncher_-_NARA_-_513295.jpg"},{"name":"Ruth Dayhoff","backlinks":["Margaret Oakley Dayhoff","User:Keilana/Female scientist list","User:Edgars2007/Sandbox","Wikipedia:Systemic bias kit","Talk:Ruth Dayhoff","Ruth E.

She was active in reaching out to students, and female students in particular, about her passion for science. In her words: As far as the future is concerned, my vision is that of a web of knowledge linking individuals, organisations, countries and continents. The research we are aiming for seeks to improve cooperation between business and the community by building “knowledge webs”, a goal that is in phase with the Europe's target of evolving from an “information society” to a “knowledge society”","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg"},{"name":"Virginia Dignum","backlinks":["Knowledge Engineering and Machine Learning Group","Frank Dignum","Wikipedia:WikiProject Academic Journals/Journals cited by Wikipedia/P55","Dignum","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women in Red/Metrics/August 2019","Talk:Virginia Dignum"],"references":["https://diievents.dii.eu/ai-summit/speaker/virginia-dignum/","https://nextconf.eu/person/virginia-dignum/","https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2196","//doi.org/10.1609%2Faimag.v30i1.2196","//www.worldcat.org/issn/2371-9621","https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/communities/en/community/humaint/event/research-seminar-prof-virginia-dignum-responsible-ai","https://ii.tudelft.nl/bnvki/?p=1352","https://www.umu.se/en/news/new-professor-with-focus-on-etics-and-ai_7181557/","https://www.humane-ai.eu/humaneai-people/","https://www.humane-ai.eu/virginia-dignum-umea-university/","http://www.aisustainability.org/virginia-dignum/","https://www.project-sherpa.eu/team/virginia-dignum/","https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/high-level-expert-group-artificial-intelligence","https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation/guidelines","https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/policy-and-investment-recommendations-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence","https://allai.nl/about-us/","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S35RA9JtLs8","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbo13mQS9eg"],"info":{"general":{"name":"Virginia Dignum","birthName":"Maria Virgínia Ferreira de Almeida Júdice Gamito","birthDate":{"date":"1964-05-02T04:00:00.000Z","age":55},"almaMater":"Utrecht University","workplaces":["Delft University of Technology","Umeå University"],"knownFor":"Artificial Intelligence","spouse":"Frank Dignum"},"tables":[],"lists":[]},"links":["AI","Artificial Intelligence","Artificial intelligence","Benelux","Bibsys","CiNii","DBLP","Delft University of Technology","Digital object identifier","European Commission","European Union","Frank Dignum","Integrated Authority File","International Standard Book Number","International Standard Name Identifier","International Standard Serial Number","Library of Congress Control Number","Lisbon","Multiannual Financial Framework","National Library of Israel","National Library of the Czech Republic","Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research","ORCID","Portugal","Royal Library of the Netherlands","Springer Publishing","Système universitaire de documentation","Umeå University","Utrecht University","Virtual International Authority File","Vrije Universiteit","Wallenberg family","WorldCat Identities","World Economic Forum"],"summary":"Maria Virgínia Ferreira de Almeida Júdice Gamito Dignum (born 2 May 1964, in Lisbon, Portugal) is a Professor of Computer Science at Umeå University, and an Associated Professor at Delft University of Technology.

She is also known for documenting and popularizing the CFOP method (sometimes referred to as the \"Fridrich method\"), one of the most commonly used methods for speedsolving the Rubik's Cube, also known as speedcubing. She is considered as one of the pioneers of speedcubing, along with Lars Petrus. Nearly all of the fastest speedcubers have based their methods on Fridrich's, usually referred to as CFOP (Cross, First 2 Layers, Orient Last Layer, Permute Last Layer).\nThe method describes solving the cube in a layer-by-layer fashion. First a \"cross\" is made on the first layer, consisting of the center piece and four edges. The first layer corners and edges of the second layer are put into their correct positions simultaneously (four pairs). The last layer is solved by first orienting and then permuting the last layer of the cube using a few sets of algorithms.","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/JessicaFridrich.jpg"},{"name":"Carol Frieze","backlinks":["Lenore Blum","Women in computing","Alan M.

Known primarily for work relating to people and computers, the bulk of her original technical work was published or presented between the late 1980s and mid-1990s.\nTwo of the first \"concept viruses\" for Microsoft products were discovered by Gordon, refuting the common belief that it was impossible to contract a virus via email. She also wrote the first report on Linux viruses in the wild. She is known for inventing the term \"vX\" to refer to Virus Exchange. Gordon has always been fascinated with linguistics, and has introduced several other terms into the computer lexicon,  including \"trigger foot\" and \"meaningfulness\".Dr. Gordon was appointed to the computer science graduate faculty of the Florida Institute of Technology   in 2004. Although she has worked for several computer security companies, including Dr. Solomon's Software, Command Software, IBM Research, and Symantec Corporation, her work has continued to be primarily academic. Sarah Gordon is an alumnus of Indiana University South Bend, where she obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in 1997. She has a master's degree in Human Behaviour and Professional Counseling, and a Ph.D in Computer Science from Middlesex University.","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg"},{"name":"Susan L.

Haas is an American computer scientist noted for her research in database systems and \ninformation integration. She is best known for creating systems and tools for the integration of heterogeneous data from diverse sources, including federated technology that virtualizes access to data, and mapping technology that enables non-programmers to specify how data should be integrated.\nHaas's work dramatically changed the research and practice of information integration. She led the Starburst project on extensible database systems, showing how diverse information could be integrated into a relational database. Her research was the foundation for IBM's DB2 LUW query processor. She was the overall architect for Garlic, a novel data federation system that provides integrated access to many data sources from a high-level nonprocedural language, and personally invented and implemented query optimization techniques that allowed Garlic to process queries efficiently, exploiting the capabilities of the underlying data sources.  Haas led the development of IBM InfoSphere Federation Server based on this technology, and was the technical lead of the IBM team which helped establish the enterprise information integration market. Laura also led the Clio project, inventing the concept and basic algorithms for schema mapping, and embodying them in the first tool to compute necessary transformations to bring data from diverse sources into a common format automatically.

Her company, Meta-Software, produced compound annual growth rate in excess of 25–30 percent every year for 18 years, and eventually became part of Synopsys, which calls HSPICE \"the 'gold standard' for accurate circuit simulation\".  In 1973 she created Advanced Micro Devices' first microprocessor, the Am9080, a clone of the Intel 8080, and in 1974, AMD's first nonvolatile memory, the 2702 2048-bit EPROM.  Earlier, she built the launch sequencer for the Sprint Anti-Ballistic Missile System for Martin Marietta.She attended Texas Tech University along with her twin brother Kim, starting her first company while still in college.She is a trans woman. After retiring from her career in technology she began transitioning, changing her name to Ashawna and undergoing medical treatment.\nAs a philanthropist, Hailey sought to reform government policies on recreational drugs.  During her life she donated to the ACLU Foundation, Code Pink, the Drug Policy Alliance, Feeding America, Rainforest Action Network, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, the Marijuana Policy Project, Erowid, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), and served\non the board of MAPS. After her death she left a US$10-Million bequest shared between MAPS, the ACLU, Drug Policy Alliance, Marijuana Policy Project, and Second Harvest Food Bank.  In what its board considered a fitting tribute to Hailey, the Marijuana Policy Project dedicated a million dollars of her bequest to the initiative that for the first time enabled voters to legalize marijuana for recreational use in Colorado.","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/HaileyA.jpg"},{"name":"Margaret Hamilton (software engineer)","backlinks":["Apollo

She was director of the Software Engineering Division of the MIT Instrumentation Laboratory, which developed on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo space program. She later founded two software companies—Higher Order Software in 1976 and Hamilton Technologies in 1986, both in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nHamilton has published more than 130 papers, proceedings and reports about sixty projects and six major programs. She is one of the people credited with coining the term \"software engineering\".On November 22, 2016, Hamilton received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama for her work leading to the development of on-board flight software for NASA's Apollo Moon missions.\n\n","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Margaret_Hamilton_1995.jpg"},{"name":"Jessica Hammer","backlinks":["Michael Martin Hammer","Maimonides School","Human-Computer Interaction Institute","Video game controversies","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women in Red/Metrics/January 2017","User talk:Davidkh","Talk:Jessica Hammer","Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Jessica Hammer","Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2017 February 3","User:Evad37/sandbox/Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Log/2017 February 3","User talk:Paopao Ge","User talk:2601:547:900:1041:7CFB:63BA:C488:FD6E"],"references":["https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/faculty","https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/05/29/can-video-games-solve-public-health-problems","https://search.proquest.com/docview/294836274","http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/a-lifelong-friend-who-challenged-the-status-quo/","http://triblive.com/news/allegheny/6855651-74/hammer-university-cmu","https://cmsw.mit.edu/jessica-hammer-what-games-mean-and-how/","https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/789795/Hammer%20CV.pdf","https://search.proquest.com/docview/435993673","https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/us/sexual-harassment-in-online-gaming-stirs-anger.html?_r=0","https://lit2quit.wordpress.com/team/consultants/jessica-hammer/","https://search.proquest.com/docview/232717183","https://killscreen.com/articles/ethiopia-one-game-design-professor-believes-young-girls-hold-key/","http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_YoungScientists2014.pdf","https://archive.org/details/devoicingofsocie00lock","https://hcii.cmu.edu/research/transformative-live-action-role-playing","https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/research/games-pain"],"info":{"general":{"name":"Jessica Hammer","residence":["Pittsburgh","Pennsylvania"],"citizenship":"USA","nationality":"United States","workInstitution":"Carnegie Mellon University","almaMater":"Columbia University","website":"http://replayable.net/"},"tables":[],"lists":[]},"links":["Asperger's syndrome","Boston Globe","Brookline, Massachusetts","Carnegie Mellon","Carnegie Mellon University","Cognitive studies","Columbia University","Ethiopia","Harvard University","Human-Computer Interaction Institute","International Standard Book Number","John L.

One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of the first linkers.  She popularized the idea of machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.\nPrior to joining the Navy, Hopper earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University and was a professor of mathematics at Vassar College. Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. Hopper began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by Howard H. Aiken. In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer.  At Eckert–Mauchly she began developing the compiler. She believed that a programming language based on English was possible.  Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers. By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the A-0 System. During her wartime service, she co-authored three papers based on her work on the Harvard Mark 1.\nIn 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC. In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on English words. In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967 the Navy recalled her to active duty.  She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the Digital Equipment Corporation, sharing her computing experiences.\nThe U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 \"Hopper\" supercomputer at NERSC. During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. A college at Yale University was renamed in her honor.  In 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology. On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Commodore_Grace_M._Hopper%2C_USN_%28covered%29.jpg"},{"name":"Susan B.

She had several best paper and an impact paper award mentioned below under awards.\nShe was an award-winning teacher at her institution and was the founder of Peer Led Team Learning for Computer Science (PLTLCS), creating the Wisconsin Emerging Scholars-Computer Science (WES-CS) program. She took the lead for an NSF ITWF Grant 0420343 that was a collaboration between eight schools doing PLTLCS, including the University of Wisconsin–Madison with Horwitz, Duke University, Georgia Tech, Rutgers University, University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, Purdue University, Beloit College, and Loyola College. They published a paper in 2009 that showed that active recruiting combined with peer-led team learning is an effective approach to attracting and retaining under-represented students in an introductory Computer Science class. She was also noted for her leadership in computing in high schools. She was a member of the Educational Testing Services Advanced Placement Computer Science Test Development Committee for ten years from 1987 to 1997, including chairing the committee for five years from 1992 to 1997 at a time when the programming language for the exam changed from Pascal to C++.","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg"},{"name":"Ayanna Howard","backlinks":["List of Brown University people","List of University of Southern California people","Index of robotics articles","Georgia Institute of Technology School of Interactive Computing","Talk:Ayanna Howard","Human-Automation Systems Laboratory","User talk:151.188.213.251","User talk:24.183.6.252","User:The Transhumanist/Sandbox51","Ayanna MacCalla Howard","Ayanna M.

During her 35-year career at NASA and its predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, she earned a reputation for mastering complex manual calculations and helped pioneer the use of computers to perform the tasks. The space agency noted her \"historical role as one of the first African-American women to work as a NASA scientist\".Johnson's work included calculating trajectories, launch windows and emergency return paths for Project Mercury spaceflights, including those for astronauts Alan Shepard, the first American in space, and John Glenn, the first American in orbit, and rendezvous paths for the Apollo Lunar Module and command module on flights to the Moon. Her calculations were also essential to  the beginning of the Space Shuttle program, and she worked on plans for a mission to Mars. In 2015, President Barack Obama awarded Johnson the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  She was portrayed by Taraji P. Henson as a lead character in the 2016 film Hidden Figures.","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Katherine_Johnson_in_2008.jpg"},{"name":"Lynne Jolitz","backlinks":["Bill Joy","List of programmers","June 30","July 14","University of California, Berkeley","Vi","386BSD","Ultrix","DragonFly BSD","Sleepycat Software","Theo de Raadt","Matthew Dillon","PicoBSD","Talk:386BSD","BSD Daemon","Computer Systems Research Group","Keith Bostic","Jordan Hubbard","BSD/OS","Berkeley Software Design","Poul-Henning Kamp","William Jolitz","Walnut Creek CDROM","Comparison of BSD operating systems","Bob Fabry","User:LinkLink~enwiki","FreeBSD","List of BSD operating systems","Marshall Kirk McKusick","Talk:Lynne Jolitz","PlayStation 3 system software","PlayStation Portable system software","User:Nixeagle/BLPs with fact tags","Outline of free software","Timeline of free and open-source software","Berkeley Software Distribution","BSD licenses","OpenBSD","Junos OS","IXsystems","Lynne Greer Jolitz","Wikipedia:WikiProject Spam/LinkReports/grok-code.com","Samuel J Leffler","NetBSD","User:Tony Sidaway/Living people/tranche 043","Michael J.

She is a pioneer in the fields of artificial intelligence, computer science, and educational computing. While working as a researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Dr. Solomon took it upon herself to understand and program in the programming language Lisp. As she began learning this language, she realized the need for a programming language that was more accessible and understandable for children. Throughout her research studies in education, Dr. Solomon worked full-time as a computer teacher in elementary and secondary schools. Her work has mainly focused on research on human-computer interaction and children as designers. While working at Bolt, Beranek and Newman, she worked with Wally Feurzeig and Seymour Papert, to create the first programming language for children, named Logo. The language was created to teach concepts of programming related to Lisp. Dr. Solomon has attained many accomplishments in her life such as being the vice president of R&D for Logo Computer Systems, Inc., when Apple Logo was developed and was the Director of the Atari Cambridge Research Laboratory. Dr. Solomon worked on the program committee of Constructing Modern Knowledge and the Marvin Minsky Institute for Artificial Intelligence in 2016. Further, she has published many writings based on research in the field of child education and technology in the classroom. Dr. Solomon has conducted workshops in elementary schools, high schools, and colleges regarding academic research and writing. She continues to contribute to the field by speaking at conferences and working with the One Laptop per Child Foundation.","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Cynthia_Solomon.jpg"},{"name":"Diane Souvaine","backlinks":["List of Harvard University people","Tufts University School of Engineering","List of Tufts University people","List of mathematicians (S)","Sweep line algorithm","Pseudotriangle","List of Radcliffe College people","List of women in mathematics","Moser spindle","Laman graph","List of people by Erdős number","David P.

She began her career in 1961 as the first woman engineer at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Pasadena, CA), designing and developing algorithms to model NASA’s Deep Space Network capabilities and automating real-time tracking systems for the Ranger and Mariner space missions using a North American Aviation Recomp II, 40-bit word size computer. Over the course of her career, she has held positions as an applied science and technology researcher and manager in industry, academia, and government. In 2007, she retired from her position as Chief Scientist of the Computational and Information Sciences Directorate at the United States Army Research Laboratory(ARL).\nUlery was among the first group of female managers at the US Army Research Laboratory. In these positions, she was also appointed Chair of the US Army Materiel Command Knowledge Management Council, and in 2002 was awarded the Army Knowledge Award for Best Transformation Initiative. She is listed in American Men and Women of Science, Who’s Who of American Women, Who’s Who in the East, Who’s Who in the World, and Who’s Who in America. She was named a Lifetime Achiever by Marquis Who's Who in 2017.\nUlery received her BA from Grinnell College in 1959, with a double major in English Literature and Mathematics. She earned her MS and PhD in Computer Science from the University of Delaware, in 1972 and 1975 respectively. In 1976, she accepted visiting faculty appointments at Cairo University in Egypt and the American University in Cairo. On her return to the U.S., she joined the Engineering Services Division of the DuPont Company, where she worked as a computer scientist and technical manager. In the early 1980s, Ulery led initiatives to develop and deploy enterprise application systems to evaluate and control product quality at DuPont sites. For these achievements she was awarded the DuPont Engineering Award for Leadership of Corporate Quality Computer Systems.

The course materials have been utilized at the junior, senior, and graduate levels in the Computer Science department.\nIn late 2011, Widom launched one of the first Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), entitled \"Introduction to Databases\". The course had more than 100,000 enrolled students, and launched at the same time as two other MOOCs by Stanford University School of Engineering faculty. In 2018, she won the Erna Hamburger prize from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne -Women in Science and Humanities Foundation.Widom earned a PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University in 1987, and BS degree from the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music in 1982.","mainImage":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Professor_Jennifer_Widom_with_workshop_participants_after_training_session.jpg"},{"name":"Mary Allen Wilkes","backlinks":["List of computer scientists","September 25","LINC","List of Wellesley College people","Wilkes (surname)","User:Rcmulcrone","Talk:Mary Allen Wilkes","User:AlexNewArtBot/ReferencesSearchResult/archive50","User:AlexNewArtBot/EducationSearchResult/archive87","User:Tony Sidaway/Living people/tranche 096","Mary Allen (disambiguation)","User talk:User9669/archive7","Index of women scientists articles","User:Edgars2007/Sandbox","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women's History/Ada Lovelace Festival of Wikipedia workshop","Wikipedia:Meetup/Women in Science Edit-a-thon - Oklahoma","Wikipedia:WikiProject Women scientists/index","Timeline of women in computing","User:Roberttomsons/Books/Women in computing"],"references":["https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/magazine/women-coding-computer-programming.html","http://www.martindale.com/Mary-Allen-Wilkes/694831-lawyer.htm"],"info":{"general":{"name":"Mary Allen Wilkes","image":"Mary Allen Wilkes Portrait.jpeg","birthDate":{"date":"1937-09-25T00:00:00.000Z"},"fields":"Computer Programming, Logic Design, Law","workplaces":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Washington University in St. Louis"],"almaMater":["Wellesley College","Harvard Law School"],"knownFor":"LINC"},"tables":[],"lists":[]},"links":["DBLP","Harvard Law School","IBM 709","International Standard Book Number","LINC","Lincoln Laboratory","Logic design","MIT Lincoln Laboratory","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","Severo Ornstein","TX-2","Virtual International Authority File","Washington University in St. Louis","Wayback Machine","Wellesley College","Wesley A.
